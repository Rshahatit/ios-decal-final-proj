Heading 2: Purpose
Raw Text: LetsDJ allows you to give a select number of people to be the DJ for your awesome party! Let your most musical friends have control and make the party a blast!
        Heading 2: Features
Bullet Points: 
Give certain friends with Spotify accounts access to this shared playlist
Once you have access, you can queue songs to the playlist
Members can vote to delete a song off the playlist (if majority of the people with access vote to delete a song, the song will get deleted)


Heading 2: Control Flow
Bullet Points: [Walk us through how your app would work - how the user would interact with it, starting from the initial screen. e.g. Users are initially presented with a splash screen, where they can log in or browse as a guest. Once done, they see a curated list of some of the newest and coolest cat outfits. Tapping on a cat outfit entry takes you to that cat outfit's listing page.]


You are hosting a party and want to have a lit soundtrack/playlist. You realize your music taste kind of sucks, so you give your 3 best friends access to this shared playlist. The main screen will have all the playlists you created. You then click on the playlist you want to use for the party. That will consist of all the songs in order of when they will play. That screen will have a button to add everyone you want to be able to contribute to this playlist. Then any person with access can click add, to search spotify and queue a song to the playlist. Also, each song in this playlist will have a down arrow key and if a person clicks it, 1 will pop up next to it. If more than half the people its shared with click it, the song will get deleted from the playlist.
